# Welcome to Happy Culture!

This game is about Bees and flowers, and doing what you can to make your little buzzing friends happy.

## How to play

- Left click to start dragging an item from the map
- Left click while dragging an object to place it.
- Hold middle click to drag camera around
- Scroll mouse to zoom in and out
- See "Buy and place" and "Trashcan" for additional controls

## Your cellphone

Everything important lies in the cellphone. There are 4 main applications you can access from there :

1. Shop where you can buy fancy flowers and new beehives.
2. Inventory where all your items lie, waiting to be placed in the world.
3. Real estate market where you can buy more terrain.
4. The Wiki where you can find various information about the game.
5. The stats board lets you see your progression.
6. The power off button lets you restart or quit the game.

## Bees

They live in beehives, and will come out if there are flowers nearby. Try to plant different type of flowers around in order to make them most happy.

Bees will search for pollen for a while, and will then go back to their hives with their loot. The accumulated pollen is then turned into honey which you can harvest and use to buy stuff on your phone.

### CAUTION

There are several ways your beehives can be damaged. It will be destroyed if it is damaged too much.

Your beehive will heal :

- Each time you harvest honey from it

Your beehive will be hurt if :

- It is full and a bee tries to add more pollen
- There are no flowers nearby for too long
- A bee comes back with bad sugar (taken from trash)

## Trashcan

There will be a trashcan in your inventory at the start of the game. You can place it wherever you want. You can even displace it later.

You can drag and drop trash in the trashcan in order to remove it from the field. If you don't want one of your wares anymore, you can also throw it in the trash.

Dropping an item from your inventory to the trash will return the item back to your inventory.

## Buy and Place

You can buy wares from the market in exchange for honey.

Once you have bought what you need, exit the shop with the back arrow, and go to your inventory. You will be able to see your newly aquired items there.

You'll then probably want to place stuff in the field. In order to do so,

1. Click on the item you want to take from your inventory

2. Drag it to the position where you want it to be

3. Left click again in order to place the item.

## Real estate

You can buy more terrain from the real estate application on your phone. Beware : the more terrain you buy, the more expensive new terrains will be.

Once you buy a new terrain, you'll see that a 10x10 square of grass added to the map in a random place. Use it as you will, but preferably to grow your bee empire!
